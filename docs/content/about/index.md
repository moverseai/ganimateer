**GANIMATEER** proposes the design and implementation of an AI-based post-processing toolset for automating the character animation process, widening the spectrum of its potential users. To achieve this goal, [Moverse](https://moverse.ai/) will leverage the in-house suite of AI-based character animation editing services to ultimately form a guided inversion toolset that will deliver realistic character animations based on user input. The toolset will be offered for experimentation to the EMIL consortium.
